-Flow-

1)Create a Process
	Decide when next process will be created (input)
	Determine total CPU time (input)
	Determine wether IO bound or CPU bound
	Determine Length of First CPU Burst in mcs 
		If IO bound cpuBurst = 2,000 - 4,000mcs
		If CPU bound cpuBurst = 10,000 - 20,000mcs


2) Events (for switching between processes)


3)Keep Statistics
	Overall CPU Utilization (percentage of time cpu spent running processes)
	Avg. CPU time per process
	Avg. waiting time for a process in 
		a) cpu 
		b) io queue
	Avg. turnaround time per process
